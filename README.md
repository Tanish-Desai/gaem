my first game using Godot ðŸ˜€!

As of now (*Full Init*), the game has the player node and the map tilesets. 

Physics have been added, and a raw design of the map is done.
More is to be done. 

**UPDATE:27|12|24**
The game is almost completed at its most basic level.
There are enemies, a larger map, background art, bg music, sfx, and different sprite animations. Not to mention even a dynamic scoreboard is added.

More features are to be added!
